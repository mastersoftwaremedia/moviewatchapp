# moviewatchapp

Created a movielist using React, implementing React Hooks, Context API and storing data locally in localStorage. 🖥 I used IMDb-API site for external movie api, but if you want, you can use any movie external api service such as The Movie DB.

## **Project Setup**

### client

**Add Credentials**

Make sure to use Git Bash if you use windows to create a .env file at the root directory of your application to hide all your sensitive information

```
touch .env
```
Add following variables to .env file:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=
```

After adding the .env file at the root directory, run the following command to open the project on localhost://3000

```
npm start
```

If you have any questions about the project, feel free to email me @ fortestingpurpose06@gmail.com
